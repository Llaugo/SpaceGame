# Satellite Forge

Introduction

A game project started in the summer 2023. The idea of the game is to build and develop your own space station / satellite. Utilizing your ground station you can gather resources, initiate research and build satellite parts to launch to space. The programming is done in python (3.11) with pygame as a GUI.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to have fun programming and playing while learning Python. Other motivation is also to gather skills and knowledge on basic programming customs and libraries. I also figured this would be a good exercise on making a larger uniform project from start to finish. Getting rehearsal on setting up a project and possibly publishing too.

Build Status

Just getting started. game.py contains the runnable code, but the game itself isn't ready.

Style

I'm using MVC design pattern to structure the code.

Licence

Python – PSF/GPL, pygame – LGPL
