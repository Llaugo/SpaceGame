# SpaceGame (Working title)

Introduction
A game project for the summer 2023. The idea of the game is to build and develop your own space station / satellite. Utilizing your own ground station you can gather resources, initiate research and build satellite parts to launch to space. The programming is done in python (3.11) and with pygame as a GUI.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have fun programming and playing. Other motivation is also to gather skills and knowledge on basic programming customs and libraries. I also figured this would be a good exercise on making a larger uniform project from start to finish. Getting rehearsal on setting up a project and possibly publishing too.

Build Status
Just getting started. The game is not playable yet.

Style
I'm using MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern to structure the code.
All the class definitions are in models.py
